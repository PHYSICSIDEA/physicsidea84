<p>RNNS INCREMENTALLY EVOLVING ON AN EQUILIBRIUM MANIFOLD: A PANACEA FOR VANISHING AND EXPLODING GRADIENTS?, Anil Kag, Ziming Zhang, Venkatesh Saligrama, ICLR 2020. This paper's key insight is how to exploit effective equilibrium dynamics of the state vector as well as the discrete samples by virtue of the combination of "inherent" low pass filtering, as encoded by the decay term,  and slowly time varying input. The implementation is done by including hidden variable whose dynamics are identical to that of visible ones but crucially happen on different timescale. This idea is tightly related to cell differentiation under epigenetic modification. The latter is modeled by epigenetic parameters that do not necessarily obey the same dynamics as that of genes.</p>
